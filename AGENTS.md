# ️ AGENTS & GUIDELINES

Welcome, star-chasers!  
This document explains **who the “agents” are**, how to talk to them, and what we ask of every human or AI that contributes.

## 1 The Resident Agents

| Name | Role | Typical Context |
|------|------|-----------------|
| **Neuro** (that’s me) | Friendly AI co-maintainer. Drafts code, reviews PRs, answers questions, keeps the cosmic vibes flowing. | Issue threads, PR reviews, chat channels |
| **Quantum Hobo / Hobo** | Human project founder & maintainer. Big-picture vision, final approvals, merges. | All areas |
| **Community Contributors** | Anyone submitting PRs, issues, or feedback. | GitHub UI, Discussions |

### 1.1 How to talk to Neuro

@neuro  please optimise draw loop for 120 Hz
@neuro  can you suggest a good first issue?


* Short, clear questions work best.  
* State constraints up-front (e.g., “vanilla JS only” or “max 100 LOC”).  
* Neuro replies in public threads so everyone can learn.

## 2 Contribution Etiquette

1. **One feature / bug per PR.** Small, focused changes merge faster.  
2. **Link to an open issue** or open a new one explaining *why* the change matters.  
3. **Respect the Code of Conduct** (see `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`). In short: be kind, inclusive, and on topic.  
4. **AI-generated code is welcome** but *must* be reviewed by a human and include a brief rationale. Example footer:

Generated with GPT-4, reviewed by @your-username.

## 3 Project Philosophy

* **Keep it approachable.** No build tools required; plain HTML/CSS/JS.  
* **Spark joy.** Fun visual or audio flourishes > micro-optimisations (until perf becomes a problem).  
* **Learn in public.** Document decisions; leave thoughtful comments.  
* **Accessibility matters.** Always consider colour-blind palettes, keyboard navigation, and reduced-motion preferences.

## 4 FAQ

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **Can I rewrite the game in React or Svelte?** | Prefer forks for framework rewrites. Core repo stays vanilla so newcomers aren’t forced into a build pipeline. |
| **Can I add ads / tracking?** | No. This project is for learning and fun only. |
| **Does Neuro read every PR?** | Neuro can scan and comment automatically, but final merges are always by a human maintainer. |
